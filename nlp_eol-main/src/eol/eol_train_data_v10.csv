When a node&#39;s catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run.

  - The following CA certificates were Removed CN = Buypass     Class 2 CA 1 CN = Root CA Generalitat Valenciana OU =     RSA Security 2048 V3

  - The following CA certificates were Added OU = AC RAIZ     FNMT-RCM CN = Amazon Root CA 1 CN = Amazon Root CA 2 CN     = Amazon Root CA 3 CN = Amazon Root CA 4 CN = LuxTrust     Global Root 2 CN = Symantec Class 1 Public Primary     Certification Authority - G4 CN = Symantec Class 1     Public Primary Certification Authority - G6 CN =     Symantec Class 2 Public Primary Certification Authority
    - G4 CN = Symantec Class 2 Public Primary Certification     Authority - G6

  - The version number of the updated root CA list has been     set to 2.11

  - Update to NSS 3.28 New functionality :

  - NSS includes support for TLS 1.3 draft -18. This     includes a number of improvements to TLS 1.3 :

  - The signed certificate timestamp, used in certificate     transparency, is supported in TLS 1.3.

  - Key exporters for TLS 1.3 are supported. This includes     the early key exporter, which can be used if 0-RTT is     enabled. Note that there is a difference between TLS 1.3     and key exporters in older versions of TLS. TLS 1.3 does     not distinguish between an empty context and no context.

  - The TLS 1.3 (draft) protocol can be enabled, by defining     NSS_ENABLE_TLS_1_3=1 when building NSS.

  - NSS includes support for the X25519 key exchange     algorithm, which is supported and enabled by default in     all versions of TLS. Notable Changes :

  - NSS can no longer be compiled with support for     additional elliptic curves. This was previously possible     by replacing certain NSS source files.

  - NSS will now detect the presence of tokens that support     additional elliptic curves and enable those curves for     use in TLS. Note that this detection has a one-off     performance cost, which can be avoided by using the     SSL_NamedGroupConfig function to limit supported groups     to those that NSS provides.

  - PKCS#11 bypass for TLS is no longer supported and has     been removed.

  - Support for 'export' grade SSL/TLS cipher suites has     been removed.

  - NSS now uses the signature schemes definition in TLS     1.3. This also affects TLS 1.2. NSS will now only     generate signatures with the combinations of hash and     signature scheme that are defined in TLS 1.3, even when     negotiating TLS 1.2.

  - This means that SHA-256 will only be used with P-256     ECDSA certificates, SHA-384 with P-384 certificates, and     SHA-512 with P-521 certificates. SHA-1 is permitted (in     TLS 1.2 only) with any certificate for backward     compatibility reasons.

  - NSS will now no longer assume that default signature     schemes are supported by a peer if there was no commonly     supported signature scheme.

  - NSS will now check if RSA-PSS signing is supported by     the token that holds the private key prior to using it     for TLS.

  - The certificate validation code contains checks to no     longer trust certificates that are issued by old WoSign     and StartCom CAs after October 21, 2016. This is     equivalent to the behavior that Mozilla will release     with Firefox 51.

  - Update to NSS 3.27.2

  - Fixed SSL_SetTrustAnchors leaks (bmo#1318561)

  - raised the minimum softokn/freebl version to 3.28 as     reported in (boo#1021636)

  - Update to NSS 3.26.2 New Functionality :

  - the selfserv test utility has been enhanced to support     ALPN (HTTP/1.1) and 0-RTT

  - added support for the System-wide crypto policy     available on Fedora Linux see     http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/CryptoPolicy

  - introduced build flag NSS_DISABLE_LIBPKIX that allows     compilation of NSS without the libpkix library Notable     Changes :

  - The following CA certificate was Added CN = ISRG Root X1

  - NPN is disabled and ALPN is enabled by default

  - the NSS test suite now completes with the experimental     TLS 1.3 code enabled

  - several test improvements and additions, including a     NIST known answer test Changes in 3.26.2

  - MD5 signature algorithms sent by the server in     CertificateRequest messages are now properly ignored.
    Previously, with rare server configurations, an MD5     signature algorithm might have been selected for client     authentication and caused the client to abort the     connection soon after.

  - Update to NSS 3.25 New functionality :

  - Implemented DHE key agreement for TLS 1.3

  - Added support for ChaCha with TLS 1.3

  - Added support for TLS 1.2 ciphersuites that use SHA384     as the PRF

  - In previous versions, when using client authentication     with TLS 1.2, NSS only supported certificate_verify     messages that used the same signature hash algorithm as     used by the PRF. This limitation has been removed.
    Notable changes :

  - An SSL socket can no longer be configured to allow both     TLS 1.3 and SSLv3

  - Regression fix: NSS no longer reports a failure if an     application attempts to disable the SSLv2 protocol.

  - The list of trusted CA certificates has been updated to     version 2.8

  - The following CA certificate was Removed Sonera Class1     CA

  - The following CA certificates were Added Hellenic     Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2015 Hellenic     Academic and Research Institutions ECC RootCA 2015     Certplus Root CA G1 Certplus Root CA G2 OpenTrust Root     CA G1 OpenTrust Root CA G2 OpenTrust Root CA G3

  - Update to NSS 3.24 New functionality :

  - NSS softoken has been updated with the latest National     Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance     (as of 2015) :

  - Software integrity checks and POST functions are     executed on shared library load. These checks have been     disabled by default, as they can cause a performance     regression. To enable these checks, you must define     symbol NSS_FORCE_FIPS when building NSS.

  - Counter mode and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) have checks     to prevent counter overflow.

  - Additional CSPs are zeroed in the code.

  - NSS softoken uses new guidance for how many Rabin-Miller     tests are needed to verify a prime based on prime size.

  - NSS softoken has also been updated to allow NSS to run     in FIPS Level 1 (no password). This mode is triggered by     setting the database password to the empty string. In     FIPS mode, you may move from Level 1 to Level 2 (by     setting an appropriate password), but not the reverse.

  - A SSL_ConfigServerCert function has been added for     configuring SSL/TLS server sockets with a certificate     and private key. Use this new function in place of     SSL_ConfigSecureServer,     SSL_ConfigSecureServerWithCertChain,     SSL_SetStapledOCSPResponses, and     SSL_SetSignedCertTimestamps. SSL_ConfigServerCert     automatically determines the certificate type from the     certificate and private key. The caller is no longer     required to use SSLKEAType explicitly to select a 'slot'     into which the certificate is configured (which     incorrectly identifies a key agreement type rather than     a certificate). Separate functions for configuring     Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses or     Signed Certificate Timestamps are not needed, since     these can be added to the optional     SSLExtraServerCertData struct provided to     SSL_ConfigServerCert. Also, partial support for RSA     Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSA-PSS) certificates     has been added. Although these certificates can be     configured, they will not be used by NSS in this     version.

  - Deprecate the member attribute authAlgorithm of type     SSLCipherSuiteInfo. Instead, applications should use the     newly added attribute authType.

  - Add a shared library (libfreeblpriv3) on Linux platforms     that define FREEBL_LOWHASH.

  - Remove most code related to SSL v2, including the     ability to actively send a SSLv2-compatible client     hello. However, the server-side implementation of the     SSL/TLS protocol still supports processing of received     v2-compatible client hello messages.

  - Disable (by default) NSS support in optimized builds for     logging SSL/TLS key material to a logfile if the     SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable is set. To enable the     functionality in optimized builds, you must define the     symbol NSS_ALLOW_SSLKEYLOGFILE when building NSS.

  - Update NSS to protect it against the Cachebleed attack.

  - Disable support for DTLS compression.

  - Improve support for TLS 1.3. This includes support for     DTLS 1.3. Note that TLS 1.3 support is experimental and     not suitable for production use.

  - Update to NSS 3.23 New functionality :

  - ChaCha20/Poly1305 cipher and TLS cipher suites now     supported

  - Experimental-only support TLS 1.3 1-RTT mode (draft-11).
    This code is not ready for production use. Notable     changes :

  - The list of TLS extensions sent in the TLS handshake has     been reordered to increase compatibility of the Extended     Master Secret with with servers

  - The build time environment variable NSS_ENABLE_ZLIB has     been renamed to NSS_SSL_ENABLE_ZLIB

  - The build time environment variable     NSS_DISABLE_CHACHAPOLY was added, which can be used to     prevent compilation of the ChaCha20/Poly1305 code.

  - The following CA certificates were Removed

  - Staat der Nederlanden Root CA

  - Update to NSS 3.22.3

  - Increase compatibility of TLS extended master secret,     don't send an empty TLS extension last in the handshake     (bmo#1243641)

  - Fixed a heap-based buffer overflow related to the     parsing of certain ASN.1 structures. An attacker could     create a specially crafted certificate which, when     parsed by NSS, would cause a crash or execution of     arbitrary code with the permissions of the user.
    (CVE-2016-1950, bmo#1245528)

  - Update to NSS 3.22.2 New functionality :

  - RSA-PSS signatures are now supported (bmo#1215295)

  - Pseudorandom functions based on hashes other than SHA-1     are now supported

  - Enforce an External Policy on NSS from a config file     (bmo#1009429)

  - CVE-2016-8635: Fix for DH small subgroup confinement     attack (bsc#1015547) Mozilla NSPR was updated to version     4.13.1: The previously released version 4.13 had changed     pipes to be nonblocking by default, and as a     consequence, PollEvent was changed to not block on     clear. The NSPR development team received reports that     these changes caused regressions in some applications     that use NSPR, and it has been decided to revert the     changes made in NSPR 4.13. NSPR 4.13.1 restores the     traditional behavior of pipes and PollEvent. Mozilla     NSPR update to version 4.13 had these changes :

  - PL_strcmp (and others) were fixed to return consistent     results when one of the arguments is NULL.

  - PollEvent was fixed to not block on clear.

  - Pipes are always nonblocking.

  - PR_GetNameForIdentity: added thread safety lock and     bound checks.

  - Removed the PLArena freelist.

  - Avoid some integer overflows.

  - fixed several comments. This update also contains     java-1_8_0-openjdk that needed to be rebuilt against the     new mozilla-nss version.

106819,NESSUS,Debian DLA-1283-2 : python-crypto security update,"This is an update to DLA-1283-1. In DLA-1283-1 it is claimed that the issue described in CVE-2018-6594 is fixed. It turns out that the fix is partial and upstream has decided not to fix the issue as it would break compatibility and that ElGamal encryption was not intended to work on its own.

The recommendation is still to upgrade python-crypto packages. In addition please take into account that the fix is not complete. If you have an application using python-crypto is implementing ElGamal encryption you should consider changing to some other encryption method.

There will be no further update to python-crypto for this specific CVE. A fix would break compatibility, the problem has been ignored by regular Debian Security team due to its minor nature and in addition to that we are close to the end of life of the Wheezy security support.

CVE-2018-6594 :

python-crypto generated weak ElGamal key parameters, which allowed attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it did not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack).

We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es) :

* Ansible fails to properly sanitize fact variables sent from the Ansible controller. An attacker with the ability to create special variables on the controller could execute arbitrary commands on Ansible clients as the user Ansible runs as. (CVE-2016-8628)

This issue was discovered by Michael Scherer (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previous versions of the openshift-ansible code base were not compatible with the latest Ansible 2.2.0.0 release. This bug fix resolves several compatibility issues with the GA version of Ansible 2.2.0.0. (BZ#1389928) (BZ#1389275)

* The hosts.ose.example inventory file had the incorrect openshift_release version set. This bug fix updates the version to match the channel in which it is shipped. (BZ#1386333)

* The etcd certificate authority created by the installer had an expiry date one year in the future. With this bug fix, the expiry date has been updated to five years, matching the lifespan of other certificate authorities created by the installer. (BZ#1391548)

* After restarting systemd-journal, master controllers and API services stopped working. This bug fix updates the installer to set Restart=always for the master controllers and API services, and this issue no longer occurs for new installations. For existing clusters, see https:// access.redhat.com/solutions/2749571. (BZ#1378929)

* When using the quick installer to install a cluster with a single master, the installer messaging suggested that an embedded etcd would be deployed. In newer versions of the quick installer, this is no longer the case, and a stand-alone etcd datastore is deployed in this scenario. This bug fix updates the quick installer messaging to match those changes. (BZ#1383961)

* Upgrades would fail if the /etc/ansible/facts.d/openshift.fact cache was missing on the system, particularly for co-located master and etcd hosts. This bug fix improves etcd fact checking during upgrades, and the issue no longer occurs. (BZ#1391608)

* Containerized upgrades from OpenShift Container Platform 3.2 to 3.3 would fail to properly create the service signing certificate due to an invalid path being used in containerized environments. This bug fix corrects that error, and containerized upgrades now create service signer certificates as a result. (BZ#1391865)

* Upgrades from OpenShift Container Platform 3.2 to 3.3 could fail with the error 'AnsibleUndefinedVariable: 'dict object' has no attribute 'debug_level''. This bug fix sets missing defaults for debug_level, and as a result the upgrade error no longer occurs.
(BZ#1392276)

* Previously in embedded environments, etcd 2.x was used to backup the etcd data before performing an upgrade. However, etcd 2.x has a bug that prevents backups from working properly, preventing the upgrade playbooks from running to completion. With this bug fix, etcd 3.0 is now installed for embedded etcd environments, which resolves the bug allowing upgrades to proceed normally. This bug only presents itself when using the embedded etcd service on single master environments.
(BZ#1382634)

* Pacemaker clusters are no longer supported, but related code that remained could in some cases cause upgrade failures. This bug fix removes the Pacemaker restart logic from the installer to avoid these issues. (BZ# 1382936)

* Previously, upgrades from OpenShift Container Platform 3.1 to 3.2 could fail due to erroneous host names being added for etcd hosts during backup. This bug fix addresses issues with conditionals and loops in templates that caused this problem, and as a result the upgrade errors no longer occur. (BZ#1392169)

121289,NESSUS,openSUSE Security Update : the Linux Kernel (openSUSE-2019-65),"The openSUSE Leap 15.0 kernel was updated to receive various security and bugfixes.

The following security bugs were fixed :

  - CVE-2018-19407: The vcpu_scan_ioapic function in     arch/x86/kvm/x86.c allowed local users to cause a denial     of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) via     crafted system calls that reach a situation where ioapic     is uninitialized (bnc#1116841).

  - CVE-2018-14625: An attacker might have bene able to have     an uncontrolled read to kernel-memory from within a vm     guest. A race condition between connect() and close()     function may allow an attacker using the AF_VSOCK     protocol to gather a 4 byte information leak or possibly     intercept or corrupt AF_VSOCK messages destined to other     clients (bnc#1106615).

  - CVE-2018-19985: The function hso_probe read if_num from     the USB device (as an u8) and used it without a length     check to index an array, resulting in an OOB memory read     in hso_probe or hso_get_config_data that could be used     by local attackers (bsc#1120743).

  - CVE-2018-16884: NFS41+ shares mounted in different     network namespaces at the same time can make     bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and cause a     use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container     user can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a     system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege     escalation cannot be fully ruled out (bnc#1119946).

  - CVE-2018-20169: The USB subsystem mishandled size checks     during the reading of an extra descriptor, related to
    __usb_get_extra_descriptor in drivers/usb/core/usb.c     (bnc#1119714).

  - CVE-2018-18397: The userfaultfd implementation     mishandled access control for certain UFFDIO_ ioctl     calls, as demonstrated by allowing local users to write     data into holes in a tmpfs file (if the user has     read-only access to that file, and that file contains     holes), related to fs/userfaultfd.c and mm/userfaultfd.c     (bnc#1117656).

  - CVE-2018-12232: In net/socket.c there was a race     condition between fchownat and close in cases where they     target the same socket file descriptor, related to the     sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat did     not increment the file descriptor reference count, which     allowed close to set the socket to NULL during     fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer     dereference and system crash (bnc#1097593).

  - CVE-2018-9568: In sk_clone_lock of sock.c, there is a     possible memory corruption due to type confusion. This     could lead to local escalation of privilege with no     additional execution privileges needed. User interaction     is not needed for exploitation. (bnc#1118319).

  - CVE-2018-16862: A security flaw was found in the way     that the cleancache subsystem clears an inode after the     final file truncation (removal). The new file created     with the same inode may contain leftover pages from     cleancache and the old file data instead of the new one     (bnc#1117186).

  - CVE-2018-19854: An issue was discovered in the     crypto_report_one() and related functions in     crypto/crypto_user.c (the crypto user configuration API)     do not fully initialize structures that are copied to     userspace, potentially leaking sensitive memory to user     programs. NOTE: this is a CVE-2013-2547 regression but     with easier exploitability because the attacker did not     need a capability (however, the system must have the     CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER kconfig option) (bnc#1118428).

  - CVE-2018-19824: A local user could exploit a     use-after-free in the ALSA driver by supplying a     malicious USB Sound device (with zero interfaces) that     is mishandled in usb_audio_probe in sound/usb/card.c     (bnc#1118152).

**Welcome to the release of phpMyAdmin version 5.0.0.**

This release includes many new features and improvements from the 4.9 series. We expect to maintain version 4 in a security capacity to support users with older PHP installations.

With this release, we are removing support of old PHP versions (5.5, 5.6, 7.0, and HHVM). These versions are outdated and are no longer supported by the PHP team.

Version 5.0 includes many coding improvements that modernize the interface. Many of these changes are transparent to users, but make the code easier to maintain. Much of this refactoring work is completed by our contract developer, Maur&iacute;cio Meneghini Fauth.

Some of the changes and new features include :

  - Enable columns names by default for CSV exports

  - Add Metro theme

  - Automatically add the index when creating an auto     increment column

  - Improvements to exporting views

  - Prompt the user for confirmation before running an     UPDATE query with no WHERE clause

  - Improvements to how errors are show to the user     (including allowing easier copying of the error text to     the clipboard)

  - Added keystrokes to clear the line (ctrl+l) and clear     the entire console window (ctrl+u)

  - Use charset 'windows-1252' when export format is MS     Excel

There are several more changes, please refer to the ChangeLog file included with the release for full details.

If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable 'non-stitched' ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

137382,NESSUS,FreeBSD : Node.js -- June 2020 Security Releases (11fcfa8f-ac64-11ea-9dab-000d3ab229d6),"Node.js reports :

Updates are now available for all supported Node.js release lines for the following issues. TLS session reuse can lead to host certificate verification bypass (High) (CVE-2020-8172) The 'session' event could be emitted before the 'secureConnect' event. It should not be, because the connection may fail to be authorized. If it was saved an authorized connection could be established later with the session ticket. Note that the https agent caches sessions, so is vulnerable to this.

The 'session' event will now only be emitted after the 'secureConnect' event, and only for authorized connections. HTTP/2 Large Settings Frame DoS (Low) (CVE-2020-11080) Receiving unreasonably large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames can consume 100% CPU to process all the settings, blocking all other activities until complete.

The HTTP/2 session frame is limited to 32 settings by default. This can be configured if necessary using the maxSettings option.
napi_get_value_string_*() allows various kinds of memory corruption (High) (CVE-2020-8174) Calling napi_get_value_string_latin1(), napi_get_value_string_utf8(), or napi_get_value_string_utf16() with a non-NULL buf, and a bufsize of 0 will cause the entire string value to be written to buf, probably overrunning the length of the buffer.

A exploit has not been reported and it may be difficult but the following is suggested :

- All users of LTS Node.js versions should update to the versions announced in this security post. This will address the issue for any non pre-built add-on.

- Maintainers who support EOL Node.js versions and/or build against a version of Node.js that did not support N-API internally should update to use the new versions of node-addon-api 1.x and 2.x that will be released soon after this announcement. ICU-20958 Prevent SEGV_MAPERR in append (High) (CVE-2020-10531) An issue was discovered in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 66.1. An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, exists in the UnicodeString::doAppend() function in common/unistr.cpp.

143225,NESSUS,openSUSE Security Update : rmt-server (openSUSE-2020-2000),"This update for rmt-server fixes the following issues :

  - Version 2.6.5

  - Solved potential bug of SCC repository URLs changing     over time. RMT now self heals by removing the previous     invalid repository and creating the correct one.

  - Version 2.6.4

  - Add web server settings to /etc/rmt.conf: Now it's     possible to configure the minimum and maximum threads     count as well the number of web server workers to be     booted through /etc/rmt.conf.

  - Version 2.6.3

  - Instead of using an MD5 of URLs for custom repository     friendly_ids, RMT now builds an ID from the name.

  - Version 2.6.2

  - Fix RMT file caching based on timestamps: Previously,     RMT sent GET requests with the header     'If-Modified-Since' to a repository server and if the     response had a 304 (Not Modified), it would copy a file     from the local cache instead of downloading. However, if     the local file timestamp accidentally changed to a date     newer than the one on the repository server, RMT would     have an outdated file, which caused some errors. Now,     RMT makes HEAD requests to the repositories servers and     inspect the 'Last-Modified' header to decide whether to     download a file or copy it from cache, by comparing the     equalness of timestamps.



  - Version 2.6.1

  - Fixed an issue where relative paths supplied to `rmt-cli     import repos` caused the command to fail.

  - Version 2.6.0

  - Friendlier IDs for custom repositories: In an effort to     simplify the handling of SCC and custom repositories,     RMT now has friendly IDs. For SCC repositories, it's the     same SCC ID as before. For custom repositories, it can     either be user provided or RMT generated (MD5 of the     provided URL). Benefits :

  - `rmt-cli mirror repositories` now works for custom     repositories.

  - Custom repository IDs can be the same across RMT     instances.

  - No more confusing 'SCC ID' vs 'ID' in `rmt-cli` output.
    Deprecation Warnings :

  - RMT now uses a different ID for custom repositories than     before. RMT still supports that old ID, but it's     recommended to start using the new ID to ensure future     compatibility.

  - Version 2.5.20

  - Updated rails from 6.0.3.2 to 6.0.3.3 :

  - actionview (CVE-2020-15169)

  - Version 2.5.19

  - RMT now has the ability to remove local systems with the     command `rmt-cli systems remove`.

  - Version 2.5.18

  - Fixed exit code for `rmt-cli mirror` and its     subcommands. Now it exits with 1 whenever an error     occurs during mirroring

  - Improved message logging for `rtm-cli mirror`. Instead     of logging an error when it occurs, the command     summarize all errors at the end of execution. Now log     messages have colors to better identify failure/success.

  - Version 2.5.17

  - RMT no longer provides the installer updates repository     to systems via its zypper service. This repository is     used during the installation process, as it provides an     up-to-date installation experience, but it has no use on     an already installed system.

  - Version 2.5.16

  - Updated RMT's rails and puma dependencies.

  - puma (CVE-2020-11076, CVE-2020-11077, CVE-2020-5249,     CVE-2020-5247 CVE-2019-16770)

  - activesupport (CVE-2020-8165)

  - railties (CVE-2019-5420)

  - Version 2.5.15

  - RMT now checks if repositories are fully mirrored during     the activation process. Previously, RMT only checked if     the repositories were enabled to be mirrored, but not     that they were actually mirrored. In this case, RMTs     were not able to provide the repository data which     systems assumed it had.

  - Version 2.5.14

  - Enable 'Installer-Updates' repositories by default

  - Fixed deprecation warning when thor encountered an     error. Also, instead of returning 0 for thor errors,     rmt-cli will return 1 instead.

  - Version 2.5.13

  - Added `rmt-cli repos clean` command to remove locally     mirrored files of repositories which are not marked to     be mirrored.

  - Previously, RMT didn't track deduplicated files in its     database. Now, to accommodate `rmt-cli repos clean`, RMT     will track all mirrored files.

  - Move the nginx reload to the configuration package which     contain nginx config files, don't reload nginx     unconditionally from main package.

  - Version 2.5.12

  - Bump gem 'config' version from 1.7.2 to 2.2.1 to fix     incompatibility Ruby 2.7 OpenStruct class;

  - Bump gem 'typhoeus' version from 1.3.1 to 1.4.0 in order     to also bump gem 'ethon' version, which caused a     'rb_safe_level' warning on Ruby 2.7;

  - Fix 'last arg as keyword arg' Ruby 2.7 warning on source     code;

  - Disable 'deprecated' warnings from Ruby 2.7; Rails 5.1     generates a lot of warnings with Ruby 2.7, mainly due to     'capturing the given block with Proc.new', which is     deprecated;

  - Improve RPM spec to consider only the distribution     default Ruby version configured in OBS;

  - Improve RPM spec to remove Ruby 2.7 warnings regarding     'bundler.

  - Move nginx/vhosts.d directory to correct sub-package.
    They are needed together with nginx, not rmt-server.

  - Fix dependencies especially for containerized usage :

  - mariadb and nginx are not hard requires, could run on     another host

  - Fix generic dependencies :

  - systemd ordering was missing

  - shadow is required for pre-install

  - Version 2.5.9

  - rmt-server-pubcloud: enforce strict authentication

  - mariadb and nginx are not hard requires, could run on     another host

Fix generic dependencies :

  - systemd ordering was missing

  - shadow is required for pre-install

Version 2.5.9

rmt-server-pubcloud: enforce strict authentication

Update from 17.11.5 to 17.11.7

Fix security issue in handling of username and gid fields CVE-2018-10995 and bsc#1095508 what implied an update from 17.11.5 to 17.11.7 Highlights of 17.11.6 :

  - CRAY - Add slurmsmwd to the contribs/cray dir

  - PMIX - Added the direct connect authentication.

  - Prevent the backup slurmctld from losing the     active/available node features list on takeover.

  - Be able to force power_down of cloud node even if in     power_save state.

Rename :

  - remain in sync with commit messages which introduced     that file

Avoid running pretrans scripts when running in an instsys: there may be not much installed, yet. pretrans code should be done in lua, this way, it will be executed by the rpm-internal lua interpreter and not be passed to a shell which may not be around at the time this scriptlet is run (bsc#1090292).

Add requires for slurm-sql to the slurmdbd package.

Package READMEs for pam and pam_slurm_adopt.

Use the new %%license directive for COPYING file. Fix interaction with systemd: systemd expects that a daemonizing process doesn't go away until the PID file with it PID of the daemon has bee written (bsc#1084125).

Make sure systemd services get restarted only when all packages are in a consistent state, not in the middle of an 'update' transaction (bsc#1088693). Since the %postun scripts that run on update are from the old package they cannot be changed - thus we work around the restart breakage.

fixed wrong log file location in slurmdbd.conf and fixed pid location for slurmdbd and made slurm-slurmdbd depend on slurm config which provides the dir /var/run/slurm (bsc#1086859).

added comment for (bsc#1085606)

Fix security issue in accounting_storage/mysql plugin by always escaping strings within the slurmdbd. CVE-2018-7033 (bsc#1085240).

Update slurm to v17.11.5 (FATE#325451) Highlights of 17.11 :

  - Support for federated clusters to manage a single     work-flow across a set of clusters.

  - Support for heterogeneous job allocations (various     processor types, memory sizes, etc. by job component).
    Support for heterogeneous job steps within a single     MPI_COMM_WORLD is not yet supported for most     configurations.

  - X11 support is now fully integrated with the main Slurm     code. Remove any X11 plugin configured in your     plugstack.conf file to avoid errors being logged about     conflicting options.

  - Added new advanced reservation flag of 'flex', which     permits jobs requesting the reservation to begin prior     to the reservation's start time and use resources inside     or outside of the reservation. A typical use case is to     prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the reservation     from using those reserved resources rather than forcing     jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources     in the time frame reserved.

  - The sprio command has been modified to report a job's     priority information for every partition the job has     been submitted to.

  - Group ID lookup performed at job submit time to avoid     lookup on all compute nodes. Enable with     PrologFlags=SendGIDs configuration parameter.

  - Slurm commands and daemons dynamically link to     libslurmfull.so instead of statically linking. This     dramatically reduces the footprint of Slurm.

  - In switch plugin, added plugin_id symbol to plugins and     wrapped switch_jobinfo_t with dynamic_plugin_data_t in     interface calls in order to pass switch information     between clusters with different switch types.

  - Changed default ProctrackType to cgroup.

  - Changed default sched_min_interval from 0 to 2     microseconds.

  - Added new 'scontrol write batch_script ' command to     fetch a job's batch script. Removed the ability to see     the script as part of the 'scontrol -dd show job'     command.

  - Add new 'billing' TRES which allows jobs to be limited     based on the job's billable TRES calculated by the job's     partition's TRESBillingWeights.

  - Regular user use of 'scontrol top' command is now     disabled. Use the configuration parameter     'SchedulerParameters=enable_user_top' to enable that     functionality. The configuration parameter     'SchedulerParameters=disable_user_top' will be silently     ignored.

  - Change default to let pending jobs run outside of     reservation after reservation is gone to put jobs in     held state. Added NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER_END reservation     flag to use old default. Support for PMIx v2.0 as well     as UCX support.

  - Remove plugins for obsolete MPI stacks :

  - lam

  - mpich1_p4

  - mpich1_shmem

  - mvapich

  - Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file. Replaced by sed     script.

Fix some rpmlint warnings.

moved config files to slurm-config package (FATE#324574).

Moved slurmstepd and man page into slurm-node due to slurmd dependency

Moved config files into slurm-node

Moved slurmd rc scripts into slurm-node

Made slurm-munge require slurm-plugins instead of slurm itself

  - slurm-node suggested slurm-munge, causing the whole     slurm to be installed. The slurm-plugins seems to be a     more base class (FATE#324574).

split up light wight slurm-node package for deployment on nodes (FATE#324574).

Package so-versioned libs separately. libslurm is expected to change more frequently and thus is packaged separately from libpmi.

Updated to 17.02.9 to fix CVE-2017-15566 (bsc#1065697). Changes in 17.0.9

Updated to 16.05.8.1

  - Remove StoragePass from being printed out in the     slurmdbd log at debug2 level.

  - Defer PATH search for task program until launch in     slurmstepd.

  - Modify regression test1.89 to avoid leaving vestigial     job. Also reduce logging to reduce likelyhood of Expect     buffer overflow.

  - Do not PATH search for mult-prog launches if     LaunchParamters=test_exec is enabled.

  - Fix for possible infinite loop in select/cons_res plugin     when trying to satisfy a job's ntasks_per_core or socket     specification.

  - If job is held for bad constraints make it so once     updated the job doesn't go into JobAdminHeld.

  - sched/backfill - Fix logic to reserve resources for jobs     that require a node reboot (i.e. to change KNL mode) in     order to start.

  - When unpacking a node or front_end record from state and     the protocol version is lower than the min version, set     it to the min.

  - Remove redundant lookup for part_ptr when updating a     reservation's nodes.

  - Fix memory and file descriptor leaks in slurmd daemon's     sbcast logic.

  - Do not allocate specialized cores to jobs using the
    --exclusive option.

Replace group/user add macros with function calls.

Fix array initialzation and ensure strings are always NULL terminated in

pam_slurm.c (bsc#1007053).

Disable building with netloc support: the netloc API is part of the devel branch of hwloc. Since this devel branch was included accidentally and has been reversed since, we need to disable this for the time being.

Conditionalized architecture specific pieces to support non-x86 architectures better.

Remove: unneeded 'BuildRequires: python'

Add: BuildRequires: freeipmi-devel BuildRequires: libibmad-devel BuildRequires: libibumad-devel so they are picked up by the slurm build.

Enable modifications from openHPC Project.

Enable lua API package build.

Add a recommends for slurm-munge to the slurm package: This is way, the munge auth method is available and slurm works out of the box.
